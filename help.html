<p><strong>You must enter a name, email, and bar number in the settings sheet to run the script.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EXCLUDE CLOSED CASES</strong><br />
Change this setting to true if you want to ignore cases listed as closed on CourtConnect. You might also change this setting to true if you are experiencing errors.<br />
This option is set to false by default because cases are often re-opened but remain listed as closed on CourtConnect.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>RUN DOCKET MONITOR</strong><br />
The script will run automatically based on scheduled triggers, but you can also start the script from the menu (Docket Monitor > run docket monitor).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>ERRORS</strong><br />
If you receive multiple emails notifying you of errors, try resetting the script (Docket Monitor > reset) and make sure you have the <a href="https://github.com/bcrawfo01/docketMonitor/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">most recent version of the script</a>. If the errors persist, delete the Docket Monitor folder and start over.</p>
